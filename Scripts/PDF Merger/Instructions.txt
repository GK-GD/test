Important Notes

Make sure that the PDF files you want to merge are in the same directory as the script or specify the full path to each file.

This script assumes that PyPDF2 is installed and available. If not, you can install it using pip: pip install PyPDF2.

The script overwrites CombinedFile.pdf if it already exists. If you want to prevent this, you can add a check to generate a unique filename or prompt the user for confirmation before overwriting.
